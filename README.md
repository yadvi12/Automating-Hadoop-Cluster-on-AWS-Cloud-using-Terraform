The goal is to install a Hadoop Cluster on machines running Linux on top of AWS Cloud.

## Usage

- Install Terraform on your system.
- Clone this repository in any location you want.
- CD to the location of the cloned repository.
- Edit the file ``terraform.tfvars`` according to your requirements.

Note: You need to have an AWS IAM user account to set the access key and secret key in the variables file.
